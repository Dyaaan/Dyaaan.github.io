                <h1>This is Dyan Marbella Abarcar. </h1>
                <p>I was born and raised in Muntinlupa City, thus you can call me "Dy" for short. I'm 20 years old, and being a teen has never come easily to me. I find life to be challenging. I'm attempting to decide what I want to do. From the record, I have six siblings, and I grew up in a humble family. My mother passed away in 2019, but my father still drives the family car. Her memories never leave me and they make me emotionally and physically ill. Without my mom, my mornings will never be the same. However, I do believe that everything happens for a purpose, and she now has a better place in paradise. I recently graduated from senior high school and am currently enrolled in an ACT course that lasts two years. This course gives me opportunities while also pointing me in the direction of a better future. "The most effective tool we have to change our lives is education."</p>
